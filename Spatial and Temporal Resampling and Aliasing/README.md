To run the code from command line, first compile with:

      >> javac Mypart1.java

      >> javac Mypart2.java

      >> javac MyExtraCredit.java

and then, run them by:

      >> java Mypart1 n s a (where n is an integer, s is a floating point, a is boolean)

      e.g. java Mypart1 16 2.0 0

      >> java Mypart2 n s fps (where n is an integer, s and fps are floating point)

      e.g. java Mypart2 64 4.0 10.0

      >> java MyExtraCredit n s1 fps s2 a (where n is an integer, s1, fps, and s2 are floating point, a is boolean)

      e.g. java MyExtraCredit 64 4.0 7.0 1.0 1

      NOTE: 

      THERE IS A RED THICK LINE THAT IS USED TO DISCERN THE ROTATION OF THE WHEEL.

      IT IS NOT A BUG.

      ALSO, FOR MyExtraCredit, TA ANSWERED THAT THE INSTRUCTION "if the fourth parameter above is a 1, then you need to perform spatial antialiasing (like part1) along with temporal antialiasing." MAY BE A TYPO.

      THUS, I FOLLOWED "if the FIFTH parameter above is a 1, then you need to perform spatial antialiasing (like part1) along with temporal antialiasing." AS THE TA ANSWERED.
