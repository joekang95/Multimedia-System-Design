To run the code from command line, first compile with:

    >> javac MyCompression.java

and then, run them by:

    >> java MyCompression filename N mode 
    (where filename is .rgb or .raw, n is a power of 2 and mode is number 1~3)

      e.g. java MyCompression image1.rgb 16 3
**NOTE:**	

**Some images may take a longer time according to the image itself and the value of N.**
